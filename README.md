# Problem statement:
Problem: Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific 
target number.
The problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target number is a 
common problem in computer science and programming. The problem statement is as 
follows:
Given an array of integers and a target number, find two numbers in the array that add up to 
the target number. If such numbers do not exist, return null or an empty result.
To solve this problem, various algorithmic techniques can be used, such as brute force 
search, hashing, and binary search.
# Hashing :
Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item 
using the shortest hashed key than to find it using the original value. It is also used in many 
encryption algorithms.A hash code is generated by using a key, which is a unique value.
Hashing is a technique in which given key field value is converted into the address of storage 
location of the record by applying the same operation on it.The advantage of hashing is that 
allows the execution time of basic operation to remain constant even for the larger side.
# Binary search:
Binary search method is a searching algorithm that follows the divide and conquer technique. 
This is based on the idea of ordered searching where the algorithm divides the sorted list into 
two halves and performs the searching. If the key value to be searched is lower than the midpoint value of the sorted list, it performs searching on the left half; otherwise it searches the 
right half. If the array is unsorted, linear search is used to determine the position
